# Job config to FSDP full fine-tune Llama 3.3 70B Instruct on a single GCP node.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Set up SkyPilot GCP: https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/user_guides/launch/launch.html#setup
#   - Log into WandB (`wandb login`) or disable `enable_wandb`
#   - Log into HF: `hf auth login`
#   - Request access to Llama 3.3: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct
#   - (optional) Mount a storage bucket below
#
# Usage:
#   oumi launch up -c configs/recipes/llama3_3/sft/70b_full/gcp_job.yaml --cluster llama70b-sft-fsdp
