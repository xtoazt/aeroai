Oumi Infer provides a unified interface for running models, whether you're deploying models locally or calling external APIs. It handles the complexity of different backends and providers while maintaining a consistent interface for both batch and interactive workflows.

## Why Use Oumi Infer?

Running models in production environments presents several challenges that Oumi helps address:

- **Universal Model Support**: Run models locally (vLLM, LlamaCPP, Transformers) or connect to hosted APIs (Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, Together, Parasail, Vertex AI, SambaNova) through a single, consistent interface
- **Production-Ready**: Support for batching, retries, error-handling, structured outputs, and high-performance inference via multi-threading to hit a target throughput.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Deploy anywhere from a single GPU to distributed systems without code changes
- **Unified Configuration**: Control all aspects of model execution through a single config file
- **Reliability**: Improved error handling, automatic saving of results during inference, and resume from failed inference run automatically
- **Adaptive Throughput**: Automatically adjust requests per minute with remote inference based on error rate

## Quick Start

Let's jump right in with a simple example. Here's how to run interactive inference using the CLI:

```bash
oumi infer -i -c configs/recipes/smollm/inference/135m_infer.yaml
```

Or use the Python API for a basic chat interaction:

```{testcode} python
from oumi.inference import VLLMInferenceEngine
from oumi.core.configs import InferenceConfig, ModelParams
from oumi.core.types.conversation import Conversation, Message, Role

# Initialize with a small, free model
engine = VLLMInferenceEngine(
    ModelParams(
        model_name="HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct",
        model_kwargs={"device_map": "auto"}
    )
)

# Create a conversation
conversation = Conversation(
    messages=[Message(role=Role.USER, content="What is Oumi?")]
)

# Get response
result = engine.infer([conversation], InferenceConfig())
print(result[0].messages[-1].content)
```

## Core Concepts

### System Architecture

The inference system is built around three main components:

1. **Inference Engines**: Handle model execution and generation
2. **Conversation Format**: Structure inputs and outputs
3. **Configuration System**: Manage model and runtime settings

Here's how these components work together:

```python
# 1. Initialize engine
engine = VLLMInferenceEngine(model_params)

# 2. Prepare input
conversation = Conversation(messages=[...])

# 3. Configure inference
config = InferenceConfig(...)

# 4. Run inference
result = engine.infer([conversation], config)

# 5. Process output
response = result[0].messages[-1].content
```

### Inference Engines

Inference Engines are simple tools for running inference on models in Oumi. This includes newly trained models, downloaded pretrained models, and even remote APIs such as Anthropic, Gemini, and OpenAI.

#### Choosing an Engine

Our engines are broken into two categories: local inference vs remote inference. But how do you decide between the two?

Generally, the answer is simple: if you have sufficient resources to run the model locally without OOMing, then use a local engine like {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.VLLMInferenceEngine`, {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.NativeTextInferenceEngine`, or {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.LlamaCppInferenceEngine`.

If you don't have enough local compute resources, then the model must be hosted elsewhere. Our remote inference engines assume that your model is hosted behind a remote API. You can use {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.AnthropicInferenceEngine`, {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.GoogleGeminiInferenceEngine`, or {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.GoogleVertexInferenceEngine`, {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.SambanovaInferenceEngine`..., to call their respective APIs. You can also use {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.RemoteInferenceEngine` to call any API implementing the OpenAI Chat API format (including OpenAI's native API), or use {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.SGLangInferenceEngine` or {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.RemoteVLLMInferenceEngine` to call external SGLang or vLLM servers started remotely or locally outside of Oumi.

For a comprehensive list of engines, see the [Supported Engines](#supported-engines) section below.

```{note}
Still unsure which engine to use? Try {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.VLLMInferenceEngine` to get started locally.
```

#### Loading an Engine

Now that you've decided on the engine you'd like to use, you'll need to create a small config to instantiate your engine.

All engines require a model, specified via {py:obj}`~oumi.core.configs.ModelParams`. Any engine calling an external API / service (such as Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, or a self-hosted server) will also require {py:obj}`~oumi.core.configs.RemoteParams`.

See {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.NativeTextInferenceEngine` for an example of a local inference engine.

See {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.AnthropicInferenceEngine` for an example of an inference engine that requires a remote API.

See {py:obj}`~oumi.inference.SambanovaInferenceEngine` for an example of an inference engine that requires a remote API.
```python
from oumi.inference import VLLMInferenceEngine
from oumi.core.configs import InferenceConfig, ModelParams
from oumi.core.types.conversation import Conversation, Message, Role

model_params = ModelParams(model_name="HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct")
engine = VLLMInferenceEngine(model_params)
conversation = Conversation(
    messages=[Message(role=Role.USER, content="What is Oumi?")]
)

inference_config = InferenceConfig()
output_conversations = engine.infer(
    input=[conversation], inference_config=inference_config
)
print(output_conversations)
```

#### Input Data

Oumi supports several input formats for inference:

1. JSONL files
    - Prepare a JSONL file with your inputs, where each line is a JSON object containing your input data.
    - See {doc}`/resources/datasets/data_formats` for more details.
2. Interactive console input
    - To run inference interactively, use the `oumi infer` command with the `-i` flag.

    ```{code-block} bash
    oumi infer -c infer_config.yaml -i
    ```

### Inference with Quantized Models

```{code-block} yaml
model:
  model_name: "model.gguf"

engine: LLAMACPP

generation:
  temperature: 0.7
  batch_size: 1
```

```{warning}
Ensure the selected inference engine supports the specific quantization method used in your model.
```

### Multi-modal Inference

For models that support multi-modal inputs (e.g., text and images):

```python
from oumi.inference import VLLMInferenceEngine
from oumi.core.configs import InferenceConfig, InferenceEngineType, ModelParams, GenerationParams
from oumi.core.types.conversation import Conversation, ContentItem, Message, Role, Type

model_params = ModelParams(
    model_name="llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf",
    model_max_length=1024,
    chat_template="llava",
)

engine = VLLMInferenceEngine(model_params)
```

```python
input_conversation = Conversation(
    messages=[
        Message(
            role=Role.USER,
            content=[
                ContentItem(
                    content="https://oumi.ai/the_great_wave_off_kanagawa.jpg",
                    type=Type.IMAGE_URL,
                ),
                ContentItem(content="Describe this image", type=Type.TEXT),
            ],
        )
    ]
)
inference_config = InferenceConfig(
    model=model_params,
    generation=GenerationParams(max_new_tokens=64),
    engine=InferenceEngineType.VLLM,
)
output_conversations = engine.infer(
    input=[input_conversation], inference_config=inference_config
)
print(output_conversations)
```

To run multimodal inference interactively, use the `oumi infer` command with the `-i` and `--image` flags.

```{code-block} bash
oumi infer -c infer_config.yaml -i --image="https://oumi.ai/the_great_wave_off_kanagawa.jpg"
```

### Distributed Inference

For large-scale inference across multiple GPUs or machines, see the following tutorial
for inference with Llama 3.3 70B on {gh}`notebooks/Oumi - Using vLLM Engine for Inference.ipynb`.

### Save and Resume

Oumi's inference system provides robust failure recovery through automatic saving and resuming of inference results. This ensures that long-running inference jobs can recover gracefully from interruptions without losing progress.

#### How It Works

The inference system automatically saves completed results to **scratch directories** as inference progresses:

1. **Incremental Saving**: Each completed conversation is immediately saved to a scratch file
2. **Automatic Resume**: On restart, the system loads any existing results and only processes remaining conversations
3. **Smart Cleanup**: Scratch files are automatically cleaned up after successful completion

#### Scratch Directory Locations

Scratch files are stored in different locations depending on your configuration:

**With Output Path Specified:**
```
<output_directory>/scratch/<output_filename>
```

For example, if your output path is `/home/user/results/inference_results.jsonl`, the scratch file will be:
```
/home/user/results/scratch/inference_results.jsonl
```

**Without Output Path (Temporary Mode):**
```
~/.cache/oumi/tmp/temp_inference_output_<hash>.jsonl
```

The hash is generated from your model parameters, generation parameters, and dataset content to ensure uniqueness across different inference runs.

### Adaptive Inference

Oumi now includes **adaptive concurrency control** for remote inference engines, which automatically adjusts the number of concurrent requests based on error rate. This feature helps optimize throughput while preventing rate limit violations and API overload.

#### How It Works

The adaptive inference system monitors the success and failure rates of API requests in real-time and dynamically adjusts concurrency:

- **Warmup Phase**: When error rates are low, concurrency gradually increases to maximize throughput
- **Backoff Phase**: When error rates exceed a threshold (default 1%), concurrency is reduced to prevent further errors. To avoid catastrophic backoff, the system waits for multiple consecutive bad windows to backoff further.
- **Recovery Phase**: After multiple consecutive good windows, the system exits backoff and resumes warmup

#### Configuration

Adaptive concurrency is **enabled by default** for all remote inference engines. You can configure it through the `remote_params` section:

```yaml
remote_params:
  use_adaptive_concurrency: true
  num_workers: 50  # Maximum concurrency (acts as RPM/QPM limit)
  politeness_policy: 60.0  # Time between adjustmests, keep to 60s for "per-minute" updates/request tracking
```

#### Benefits

- **Rate Limit Protection**: Automatically reduces load when hitting API limits
- **Optimal Throughput**: Dynamically finds the sweet spot for maximum performance
- **Resilient Operation**: Recovers gracefully from temporary API issues
- **No Manual Tuning**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults

The system starts at 50% of maximum concurrency and adjusts based on observed error rates, ensuring reliable operation across different API providers and conditions.
