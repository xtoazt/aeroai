Evaluating with MT Bench is a 2-step process. In the first step, we run inference for your model to generate answers for 80 multi-turn MT-bench questions. In the second step, we generate judgments (GPT-4 is the default judge) comparing your model's answers vs. reference answers. Each answer is scored [1, 10], considering factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail."

      "**Introduction:**\n",
      "As I stepped off the plane in Honolulu, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and relaxation wash over me. The warm tropical air, the sound of ukulele music drifting through the airport, and the stunning beaches beckoning me to come and explore ‚Äì I knew that I was in for an unforgettable adventure. My recent trip to Hawaii was a journey of discovery, where I immersed myself in the rich cultural heritage, breathtaking natural beauty, and warm hospitality of this enchanting island.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Must-see Attractions:**\n",
      "One of the first things that caught my attention was the historic Pearl Harbor. A somber reminder of the island's complex history, the USS Arizona Memorial is a poignant tribute to the lives lost during the attack. From there, I headed to the iconic Diamond Head State Monument, an imposing volcanic crater perched atop a lush green slope. The hike to the summit offered breathtaking views of the ocean and surrounding landscape, making it a must-do activity for any visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cultural Experiences:**\n",
      "As I delved deeper into the island's culture, I was struck by the warm and welcoming nature of the locals. I attended a traditional Hawaiian luau, where I feasted on local delicacies like kalua pig and poke bowls. I also visited the Bishop Museum, which offers a fascinating glimpse into the island's history, from ancient Polynesian times to modern-day surfing culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips and Insights:**\n",
      "If you're planning a trip to Hawaii, here are a few tips to keep in mind:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Be sure to check the weather forecast before your trip, as the island's tropical climate can be unpredictable.\n",
      "* Consider visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or September-November) for fewer crowds and lower prices.\n",
      "* Don't miss the stunning sunsets ‚Äì they're truly unforgettable!\n",
