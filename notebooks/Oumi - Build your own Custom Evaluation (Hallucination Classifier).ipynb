    "This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate a Large Language Model (LLM) classifier using Oumi's custom evaluation. In particular, we focus on a binary hallucination classifier for open-book question-answering (Q&A). Given a context document and a hypothesis, the classifier’s task is to determine whether the hypothesis is grounded in the context (i.e., not hallucinated). The context can be thought of as a text snippet retrieved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while the hypothesis represents an LLM-generated response. \n",

    "The underlying model used for this assessment is a generative LLM, which produces responses in free text. As a result, the prompt must explicitly specify the desired format for the response, and post-processing logic is needed to extract the prediction from the model's free-form response."

The evaluation function first runs inference, using the `inference_engine` that has been instantiated based on the `YAML` configuration (`inference_engine: NATIVE`; see Step 3). During inference, the engine will append the LLM's (assistant's) response into each conversation, as its last message. Thus, we extract the predictions from the last messages and store them in a list (`y_pred`). We also store the corresponding labels in a list (`y_true`). The labels can be found in the conversations' metadata, as discussed earlier (see section: Create the Evaluation Dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the lists of predictions (`y_pred`) and labels (`y_true`), we can compute any relevant metrics (F1, Precision, Recall, BACC, etc). In this notebook we choose the Balanced Accuracy (BACC) from the sklearn library. The final step is to return all computed metrics in a dict.\n",

    "Note that registering an evaluation function has been designed with flexibility as the primary goal. There are **no requirements on what inputs to use**; for example: whether to use Oumi's inference engine, or leverage the input dataset. These are only provided for user convenience. In practice, you can **use your own inference** or not use one. You also don't have to pass a dataset into this function; you can **read data from any source you want**: a file, a database, your custom function, or not use a dataset during evaluation. "
